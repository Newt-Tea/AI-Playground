# Sudoku Generator Implementation Plan
## Project Overview
This document outlines a step-by-step approach for building a Sudoku generator that supports dynamic board sizes, ensures unique solutions, and includes robust logging. The plan breaks down the development process into small, iterative chunks that build on each other.

# Development Phases
## Phase 1: Foundation - Setting Up Core Classes
### Prompt 1: Project Setup & Basic Cell Class
I'm building a Sudoku generator that supports n×n boards (where n is a perfect square). Let's start by setting up the project structure and implementing the Cell class.

1. Create a project structure with:
   - `src/` directory for core code
   - `tests/` directory for test files
   - Basic `__init__.py` files
   - A `requirements.txt` with pytest

2. Implement a basic Cell class in `sudoku/cell.py` that:
   - Initializes with value (default None), row, column
   - Has basic getters and setters
   - Includes string representation

3. Create tests in `tests/test_cell.py` to verify:
   - Cell initialization
   - Getting/setting values
   - String representation

Use pytest for testing. Implement with clean code practices and thorough docstrings.

### Prompt 2: Enhanced Cell Class with Domain Values
Now let's enhance the Cell class to support tracking possible values (domain). Building on our previous implementation:

1. Update the Cell class in `sudoku/cell.py` to:
   - Add a `possible_values` attribute that stores a set of values the cell can take
   - Initialize `possible_values` based on board size if not provided
   - Add a `get_position()` method that returns (row, col)
   - Add a `copy()` method for creating deep copies of the cell

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_cell.py` to verify:
   - Possible values initialization and manipulation
   - Get position functionality
   - Deep copying works as expected
   - Edge cases (empty possible values, etc.)

Ensure all existing tests still pass and the new functionality is thoroughly tested.

### Prompt 3: Basic Board Class Structure
Let's implement the foundational Board class that will represent our Sudoku grid. Building on our Cell implementation:

1. Create `sudoku/board.py` with a Board class that:
   - Takes a size parameter (n) in the constructor
   - Validates that n is a perfect square
   - Creates an n×n grid of Cell objects
   - Calculates and stores the subgrid size (sqrt(n))
   - Provides basic getters/setters for accessing cells

2. Create tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - Board initialization with valid sizes (4, 9, 16)
   - Error handling for invalid sizes (3, 7, etc.)
   - Getting/setting cell values
   - Basic board properties (size, subgrid size)

Make sure to implement proper error handling and validation. Use our existing Cell class to represent each position on the board.

### Prompt 4: Board Display and Utilities
Let's add display capabilities and utility methods to our Board class. Building on our previous implementation:

1. Enhance the Board class in `sudoku/board.py` to:
   - Implement a `__str__` method that nicely formats the board with grid lines
   - Add a `print_grid()` method that prints the board to console
   - Add a `is_empty(row, col)` method to check if a cell is empty
   - Add a `get_empty_positions()` method to get all empty cell positions

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - String representation includes proper formatting
   - Empty cell detection works correctly
   - Empty cell listing returns correct positions

### Prompt 5: Core Validation Logic
Now let's implement the core validation logic for our Sudoku board. Building on our previous code:

1. Enhance the Board class in `sudoku/board.py` to add:
   - `is_safe(row, col, num)` method that checks if placing 'num' at position (row, col) is valid according to Sudoku rules:
     - Check the row constraint
     - Check the column constraint
     - Check the subgrid constraint
   - `is_valid()` method that checks if the entire board is valid

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - Safety checking works for row, column, and subgrid constraints
   - Various test cases with valid and invalid placements
   - Full board validation works correctly

Make these methods efficient as they'll be called frequently during puzzle generation and solving.

### Prompt 6: Constraint Propagation
Let's implement constraint propagation to maintain possible values for cells. Building on our previous work:

1. Enhance the Board class in `sudoku/board.py` to add:
   - `update_possible_values(row=None, col=None)` method that:
     - Updates the possible values for cells in the same row, column, and subgrid when a number is placed
     - If row and col are provided, updates possible values for that specific cell
     - Removes values that would violate Sudoku constraints
     - If no arguments provided, updates possible values for all cells

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - Possible values are correctly updated and reset
   - Constraint propagation works as expected
   - Updates properly propagate constraints across the board
   - Possible values are correctly updated for the entire board
   - Possible values are correctly updated for individual cells

This constraint propagation will be key for efficient solving and generation algorithms later.

### Prompt 7: Deep Copying the Board
Let's implement the ability to create deep copies of our Board, which will be essential for trying different solutions. Building on our previous work:

1. Enhance the Board class in `sudoku/board.py` to add:
   - `copy()` method that:
     - Creates a new Board instance
     - Deep copies all Cell objects and their states
     - Preserves all board properties and constraints

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - Deep copying creates a completely independent board
   - Modifying the copy doesn't affect the original
   - Copying works for boards of different sizes and states

Ensure that the deep copy implementation is thorough and doesn't leave any shared references between the original and copied boards.

### Prompt 8: Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) Heuristic
Let's implement the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic, which is crucial for efficient solving. Building on our previous code:

1. Enhance the Board class in `sudoku/board.py` to add:
   - `get_mrv_cell()` method that:
     - Finds the empty cell with the fewest remaining possible values
     - Returns the position (row, col) of this cell
     - Returns None if no empty cells exist

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - MRV correctly identifies cells with fewest options
   - MRV handles ties appropriately
   - MRV returns None for a filled board
   - MRV works with different board sizes

This heuristic will significantly speed up our solving algorithm by prioritizing the most constrained cells.
## Phase 2: Solver Implementation
### Prompt 9: Solution Counter for Uniqueness Validation
Let's implement a solution counter to ensure our generated puzzles have unique solutions. Building on our previous code:

1. Enhance the Board class in `sudoku/board.py` to add:
   - `count_solutions()` method that counts the number of valid solutions for the board
     - Counts the number of solutions up to max_count
     - Returns early once max_count is reached

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - Solution counter works efficiently with MRV heuristic
   - Solution counter correctly identifies unique and multiple solutions
   - Solution counter correctly identifies puzzles with 0, 1, or multiple solutions

This functionality will be essential for verifying that our generated puzzles have exactly one solution.

### Prompt 10: Basic Clue Removal Strategy
Let's implement a basic clue removal strategy to generate puzzles with a specified number of clues. Building on our previous code:

1. Enhance the Board class in `sudoku/board.py` to add:
   - `remove_clues(num_clues)` method that removes clues from the board while ensuring a unique solution
     - Randomly removes clues while ensuring the specified number of clues remain
     - Clue removal ensures unique solutions

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_board.py` to verify:
   - Clue removal works efficiently with MRV heuristic
   - Clue removal correctly generates puzzles with the specified number of clues
   - Clue removal ensures the puzzle has a unique solution

### Prompt 11: Enhanced Solver with MRV Heuristic
Now let's create the SudokuSolver class that will solve Sudoku puzzles. Building on our previous classes:

1. Create `sudoku/solver.py` with a SudokuSolver class that:
   - Has a basic initialization method
   - Can accept a Board object to solve
   - Includes a skeleton for a `solve(board)` method

2. Create tests in `tests/test_solver.py` to verify:
   - Solver initialization
   - Basic solver properties
   - Interface with the Board class

This will establish the foundation for our solving algorithm that we'll implement next.

### Prompt 12: Basic Backtracking Algorithm
Let's implement a basic backtracking algorithm for our SudokuSolver. Building on our previous code:

1. Enhance the SudokuSolver class in `sudoku/solver.py` to:
   - Implement a `solve(board)` method using recursive backtracking that:
     - Finds an empty cell
     - Tries each possible value (1 to n)
     - Recursively attempts to solve with that value
     - Backtracks if no solution is found
   - Return True if a solution is found, False otherwise
   - Have a `print_solution()` method that prints the solved board

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_solver.py` to verify:
   - Solver correctly solves simple puzzles
   - Solver correctly identifies unsolvable puzzles
   - Solver works with different board sizes (4×4, 9×9)

Make the solver efficient by only trying valid moves at each step. This basic implementation will be enhanced in the next steps.

### Prompt 13: Final Integration and Performance Optimization

   - Different board sizes are handled efficiently

4. Create benchmarking tests to measure:
   - Success rates for different configurations
   - Memory usage

Make final adjustments to ensure the generator meets all requirements in terms of functionality, performance, and usability.

### Prompt 14: Command-Line Interface
Let's create a command-line interface for our Sudoku generator. Building on our complete implementation:

1. Create `sudoku/cli.py` with functionality to:
   - Parse command-line arguments (board size, clues, log level)
   - Interface with the SudokuGenerator class
   - Provide a user-friendly entry point for the application

2. Extend tests in `tests/test_cli.py` to verify:
   - Command-line arguments are parsed correctly
   - Generator interfaces correctly with the CLI
   - End-to-end puzzle generation works from the command line

This completes the core functionality of our Sudoku generator.
